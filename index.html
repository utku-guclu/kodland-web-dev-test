      <p class="main-text">A Pop-It (also known as Go Pop and Last One Lost) is a fidget toy consisting of a
        usually-brightly colored silicone tray with pokable bubbles, similar to bubble wrap, that can be flipped and
        re-used. They come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes, and are marketed as a stress-reliever. They rose
        in popularity in the spring of 2021 due to TikTok influencers as well as boredom and stress attributed to the
        COVID-19 pandemic.
